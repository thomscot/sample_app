 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

/* the line require _ tree . ensures that all CSS files in the app/assets/stylesheets directory 
(including the tree subdirectories) are included into the application CSS.

The line require _ self specifies where in the loading sequence the CSS in application.css itself gets included.
